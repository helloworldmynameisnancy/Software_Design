synopsis: it may help to delete and start over the writing part

details:

What we have in place is holding us back to writing well. I sincerely think we can benefit from delete and restart.

Delete the entire written part. Then, jot down on a piece of paper the key topics you want to cover. Then stich those together using fluent words, conversational tone, bringing in the details from the readers' point of view rather than writer's point of view.
