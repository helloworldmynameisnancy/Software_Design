x canary tests

x get_location returns the time and location that the service returns

x get_location returns a string "network error: service unreachable" if the service throws an exception
x get_location returns a string "service failed to respond" if the service throws an exception

x get_astronauts returns empty list if service returns empty list
x get_astronauts returns list with one name if service returns a list with one name
x get_astronauts returns list with two name if service returns a list with two name already in sorted order

x get_astronauts returns list with two name in sorted order if service returns a list with two name in unsorted order
x get_astronauts returns a string "network error: service unreachable" if the service throws an exception
x get_astronauts returns a string "service failed to respond" if the service throws an exception

x get_astronauts returns list with two names in sorted order if service returns a list with two names where the last names are the same but first names are different and in unsorted order
x get_astronaut returns list with two name in sorted order if service returns list with two names unsorted where one name includes three parts

x get response returns response from the webservice for astronauts names

x parse response returns astronauts names for ISS from the given sample data
x parse response returns astronauts names  for ISS from the another sample data

x get astronauts names calls the above two functions
x get astronauts throws an exception if get response throws an exception
x get astronauts throws an exception if parse response throws an exception

x get location response returns response from the webservice for ISS time and location

x parse response returns timestamp and location from the given sample data
x parse response returns timestamp and location from the another sample data

x get location calls parse response and get location response
x get location returns the time in CT instead of the time stamp

x get location returns the place with city and state of ISS
x get location returns unknown location if ISS location unknown

x get location throws an exception if get response throws an exception
x get location throws an exception if parse response throws an exception


x Let's write a program to print the details we expect, using the functions we designed so far
x Let's modify the build so that when we run
x paver
 it runs the tests
x paver run
 it executes the program.
